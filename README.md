# Software-Testing-Techniques
This repository contains the research paper "Functional and Non-Functional Testing Techniques," exploring essential methodologies for software quality and reliability. It covers functional testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance) and non-functional testing (performance, usability, security, reliability, compatibility).

## Introduction
In the field of software development, ensuring the quality and reliability of software systems is of great importance. Testing is essential to this process as it systematically assesses software products to find flaws and ensure that they adhere to specifications. Software testing is divided into two main techniques: Functional Testing and Non-Functional Testing.

## Functional Testing
Functional testing focuses on validating the functional behavior of a software system. These testing techniques confirm that a software system functions as intended. It seeks to ensure that the system correctly carries out its intended functions and generates the anticipated outputs. This type of testing primarily focuses on the system's functional requirements.

## Types of Functional Testing

* Unit Testing: Validates individual components or units of the software for correctness.
Integration Testing: Checks the interaction between integrated units or components.
System Testing: Verifies that the complete system meets the specified requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Ensures the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for delivery.
Non-Functional Testing
While functional testing focuses on the system's behavior, non-functional testing concentrates on evaluating the quality attributes of a software system. Non-functional testing looks at elements such as performance, scalability, stability, usability, security, and compatibility that go beyond the basic capabilities.

## Types of Non-Functional Testing
Performance Testing: Assesses the speed, responsiveness, and stability of the software under various conditions.
Usability Testing: Evaluates the user-friendliness and overall user experience of the software.
Security Testing: Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures the software is protected against threats and attacks.
Reliability Testing: Determines the software's ability to function correctly under specific conditions over a period.
Compatibility Testing: Ensures the software works well across different devices, browsers, and operating systems.

## Conclusion
Both functional and non-functional testing are crucial for ensuring the overall quality of software systems. Functional testing ensures that the software behaves as expected and meets the specified functional requirements, while non-functional testing ensures the software's quality attributes meet the required standards. Together, these testing techniques help deliver robust, reliable, and user-friendly software products.
